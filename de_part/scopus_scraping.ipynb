Previous studies on the roll-to-roll system, which mainly focused on the high-tension situations and little described the low-strength materials, are insufficient. To explore the transportation of low-strength materials, we study the tension distribution of continuous moving flexible one-dimensional materials on a steady-state track. First, we propose a numerical method to calculate the steady-state track of low-strength sheet between rolls considering the gravity, as well as size and position of rolls. Then we obtain the optimum sag at different size and position of rolls. We find out that there is a lower limit of the sheet's strength-density ratio (the Minimum Specific Strength) for a specific set of size and position of rolls. Finally, we establish a method to calculate the lower limit approximately for engineering use. Our method can be generalized in manufacturing other low-strength flexible thin-sheet materials as well.\",\n",

First, we propose a numerical method to calculate the steady-state track of low-strength sheet between rolls considering the gravity, as well as size and position of rolls. Then we obtain the optimum sag at different size and position of rolls. We find out that there is a lower limit of the sheet's strength-density ratio (the Minimum Specific Strength) for a specific set of size and position of rolls. Finally, we establish a method to calculate the lower limit approximately for engineering use. Our method can be generalized in manufacturing other low-strength flexible thin-sheet materials as well.\",\n",

There is never a direct contact between user and cryogenic medium in any of system operation mode (closed supply system). Cryosauna is cooled down by filling with cold vapor of liquid nitrogen. Supply system is considered open because it allows for direct contact between user and cryogenic medium. Open supply system of cryosauna is primary and most questionable issue of its operational safety, particularly after tragic accident in October 2015. This paper presents the comparative analysis of classic cryochamber and cryosauna from safety point of view. Both devices have been analyzes and tested on existing systems in operation.

Many techniques have been developed for damage detection of structures in the literature. In this paper a new technique, a so called MAC-FMSO technique, is developed by using a combination of Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) and Fast Multi Swarm Optimization (FMSO) techniques. By using this method, not only the damage location can be assured, but also the loss of strength and loss of stiffness of structures might be quantified. The first stage is to obtain the damaged member's location by using second level of damage detection techniques, such as mode shape curvature method, damage locating vector, or strain energy method. After obtaining the damaged member, the MACFMSO technique is used to obtain the loss of stiffness from the candidate of damaged members. The results show that the MAC-FMSO algorithm has the ability to predict the loss of stiffness in the damaged members. In this case, the MAC-FMSO technique can be considered as an efficient and effective tool at the third level of damage detections. This is because this technique successfully measures the loss of strength or loss of stiffness of the damage member or part of structures. At the end of the paper, the MAC-FMSO technique is applied to predict the location of damage and loss of stiffness of three different structures. The first application is a simply supported beam with three different damage scenarios; the second application is a 13-bar plane truss structure with two different scenarios, and the third application is a shear building structure with three different scenarios.

It was found that the correlation coefficients of regression formulas for the different cooling effects remained around 0.99, suggesting a significant fit. If the asphalt temperature of roads reached 60 °C, the cooling coating effect was nearly to 10 °C. Moreover, the cooling effects could be accurately evaluated and forecasted using the linear regressions. The present and results therefore show potential applications for the investigations of the cooling performance under wheel wear, chemical etching, dust pollution and other conditions.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': '© 2017 Elsevier LtdThe disposal of fly ash poses increasingly difficult problems for many urbanized regions. A viable solution to the problem is reclamation of fly ash for civil engineering applications. Previous researches shown that fly ash is a potential source of construction material and soil stabilizer. Although it is one of the lowest-cost and most widely used materials in the world, cement raises many concerns for the environment and human health. Many studies have been conducted with the aim of reducing the cost of cement for soil stabilization; one option is to partially replace cement with waste materials such as fly ash. This paper presented a laboratory study on the effectiveness of fly ash cement-improved Singapore marine clay (FACC) through tests including unconfined compression, split tensile, Bender element, and isotropic compression tests. The effectiveness of FACC in soft clay treatment was discussed in detail by comparing its geotechnical properties with those of Ordinary Portland Cement-admixed clay (OPCC). Specimens with 20–100% cement content, 100–133% water content, and 7–150 days curing periods were used for the FACC and OPCC experiments. The results showed that the effectiveness of FACC was dependent on both the geotechnical property values and ratios, which were related to cement content, water content, and curing period. It was found that for specimens with high cement content (50–100%) and long curing period (90–150 days), the strength ratio of the FACC to OPCC specimens was as high as 70–85%. The stiffness ratio and isotropic primary yielding stress ratio were also higher than 60% at 90 days. Specimens with low cement content or high water content showed low geotechnical property values and/or ratios, which indicated lower levels of effectiveness. Based on experimental observations, a new function for estimating geotechnical property ratios was proposed and then proved to be effective.',\n",

Recycling of sandblasting waste collected from the surface treatment process in the solar industry. Sand blasting waste is mainly composed of Al2O3, and also contains very small portion of silicon and SiC. Water-retaining porous ceramic (WRPC) samples, comprising waste diatomite and sandblasting waste, with excellent humidity control performance were prepared. The appearance and structural properties of the samples were investigated through analysis of water absorption and compressive strength, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electronic microscopy. Moreover, the water retention performance levels of the samples at various heating temperatures were investigated. The WRPC samples prepared at the heating temperature of 1,270 °C meet the Standards for Japan Interlocking Block Pavement Engineering Association (compressive strength > 3 MPa, water absorption > 70%). At high heating temperatures, the quartz of the WRPC samples completely changed to cristobalite, thus affording the WRPC samples favorable chemical properties and heat stability. When the WRPC samples were sintered at high temperatures (1,200–1,270 °C), because of the driving force of sintering, the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs exhibited neck growth. The samples featured high compressive strength, low water absorption, and high water-retention performance. The results revealed that the WRPC samples could maintain a good water-retention performance for 10–15 h and better than in the foamed glass material (4 h).

       "  'abstracts': \"In this opinion piece, we discuss how to place evolution in the context of origin-of-life research. Our discussion starts with a popular definition: 'life is a self-sustained chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution'. According to this definition, the origin of life is the same as the origin of evolution: evolution is the 'end' of the origin of life. This perspective, however, has a limitation, in that the ability of evolution in and of itself is insufficient to explain the origin of life as we know it, as indicated by Spiegelman's and Lincoln and Joyce's experiments. This limitation provokes a crucial question: What conditions are required for replicating systems to evolve into life? From this perspective, the origin of life includes the emergence of life through evolution: evolution is a 'means' of the origin of life. After reviewing Eigen's pioneering work on this question, we mention our ongoing work suggesting that a key condition might be conflicting multi-level evolution. Taken together, there are thus two questions regarding the origin of life: how evolution gets started, and how evolution produces life.

Our discussion starts with a popular definition: 'life is a self-sustained chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution'. According to this definition, the origin of life is the same as the origin of evolution: evolution is the 'end' of the origin of life. This perspective, however, has a limitation, in that the ability of evolution in and of itself is insufficient to explain the origin of life as we know it, as indicated by Spiegelman's and Lincoln and Joyce's experiments. This limitation provokes a crucial question: What conditions are required for replicating systems to evolve into life? From this perspective, the origin of life includes the emergence of life through evolution: evolution is a 'means' of the origin of life. After reviewing Eigen's pioneering work on this question, we mention our ongoing work suggesting that a key condition might be conflicting multi-level evolution. Taken together, there are thus two questions regarding the origin of life: how evolution gets started, and how evolution produces life. Evolution is, therefore, at the centre of the origin of life, where the two lines of enquiry must meet. This article is part of the themed issue 'Reconceptualizing the origins of life'.\",\n",

In the boid swarm simulations, the nucleation, organization and collapse dynamics were found to be more diverse in larger flocks than in smaller flocks. In the second analysis, large web data, consisting of shared photos with descriptive tags, tended to group together users with similar tendencies, allowing the network to develop a core-periphery structure. We show that the generation rate of novel tags and their usage frequencies are high in the higher-order cliques. In this case, novelty is not considered to arise randomly; rather, it is generated as a result of a large and structured network.

All rights reserved.Organic spintronic devices have been appealing because of the long spin life time of the charge carriers in the organic materials and their low cost, flexibility and chemical diversity. In previous studies, the control of resistance of organic spin valves is generally achieved by the alignment of the magnetization directions of the two ferromagnetic electrodes, generating magnetoresistance. However, interfacial diffusion between magnetic electrodes and organic spacer layers is a serious problem in the organic spintronics which complicates attempts to understand the spin-dependent transport mechanism and hurts the achievement of a desirably high magnetoresistance. In this chapter, we present a technique to deposit nanodots instead of atoms onto the organic layer using buffer layer assist growth. Organic spin valves using this method exhibit a sharper interface and a giant MR of up to ~300%. Analysis of the current-voltage characteristics indicates that the spin-dependent carrier injection correlates with the observed MR. Furthermore, we employ a new knob to tune the resistance of organic spin valves by adding a thin ferroelectric interfacial layer between the ferromagnetic electrode and the organic spacer. We show that the resistance can be controlled by not only the spin alignment of the two ferromagnetic electrodes, but also by the electric polarization of the interfacial ferroelectric layer: the MR of the spin valve depends strongly on the history of the bias voltage which is correlated with the polarization of the ferroelectric layer; the MR even changes sign when the electric polarization of the ferroelectric layer is reversed. This new tunability can be understood in terms of the change of relative energy level alignment between ferromagnetic electrode and the organic spacer caused by the electric dipole moment of the ferroelectric layer. These findings enable active control of resistance using both electric and magnetic fields, opening up possibility for multistate organic spin valves and shed light on the mechanism of the spin transport in organic spin valves.',\n",

Studies in logistic services have been mainly focused on service gaps, an aspect related to cognitive satisfaction in customers. Many studies have been conducted to evaluate logistics service quality using SERVQUAL and the Kano model. However, these are insufficient in addressing all aspects of logistics provision.

A case study in supporting logistics services has been chosen to validate the proposed model, and a survey through face-to-face questionnaires involving 157 customers was carried out.

An electrocatalytic membrane reactor (ECMR) with a three-dimensional (3D) electrode has been successfully designed for the selective oxidation of alcohols with high current efficiency to the corresponding acids or ketones. The anode electrode was fabricated by the in situ loading of one-dimensional (1D) Co3O4 nanowires (NWs) on the conductive porous Ti membrane (Co3O4 NWs/Ti) via the combination of a facile hydrothermal synthesis and subsequent thermal treatment.

       "  'description': 'Electrochemical oxidation has attracted vast interest as a promising alternative to traditional chemical processes in fine chemical synthesis owing to its fast and sustainable features. An electrocatalytic membrane reactor (ECMR) with a three-dimensional (3D) electrode has been successfully designed for the selective oxidation of alcohols with high current efficiency to the corresponding acids or ketones. The anode electrode was fabricated by the in situ loading of one-dimensional (1D) Co3O4 nanowires (NWs) on the conductive porous Ti membrane (Co3O4 NWs/Ti) via the combination of a facile hydrothermal synthesis and subsequent thermal treatment.

This collection of findings is important for further engineering development of water-soluble classes of silicon electronics.',\n",

Accurate measurement of metabolically active tumors may improve optimal delivery of radiation treatment.

This research combined two methods in improving accuracy of small tumor volume estimation: The tumor targeted blind deconvolution and the resampling method, and assessed it using the thresholding method on simulated PET images of tumors sized 10.5 mm and 14 mm at Tumor to Background Ratios (TBRs) of 4:1 and 10:1 reconstructed with (AW)-OSEM algorithm. Results showed that the local blind deconvolution method significantly decreased volume error rate of small tumors (<2 cm) compared with the original non-deconvolved images.

The best segmented volume was measured in locally deconvolved and resampled image for the tumor size of 14 mm at TBR of 10. The estimated volume error rate was found as 0.74% for this tumor. In addition, the computation time is significantly reduced ∼ 13-fold using the local extraction method with resampling.

In this paper, it was aimed to classify the UF-EMG signals recorded from pediatric patients during the UF-EMG tests in Urodinami Center of Gülhane Education and Research Hospital using ANN. 773 (80%) of the 967 patients with an average age of 8 were used for training and 194 (20%) were used for the test. In YSA, the contribution of the features obtained from the EMG signals played a crucial role and was the main reason to improve the signal classification from 58% to 84.02%. The new classification method created by the obtained data does facilitate the interpretation of UF-EMG results for the clinical personnel in diagnosis, follow-up and treatment of patients. It is also aimed that the pediatric patients living in regions with less access to health care can be treated by providing an early and easy preliminary diagnostic tool.',\n",

Vegetation is shown to preferentially dissipate energy at frequencies higher than the spectral peak for single- and double-peaked wave spectra. Idealized simulations of Jamaica Bay with STeady-state spectral WAVE (STWAVE) demonstrate the potential for vegetation to provide shoreline protection by reducing wave height under severe wind and water level conditions.',\n",

We first introduce key findings in cancer cell migration under the influence of the physical environment, which is systematically controlled by microengineering technology, followed by multi-cues of physico-chemical factors, which represent the complexity of the tumor environment. Recognizing that cancer cells constantly communicate not only with each other but also with tumor-associated cells such as vascular, fibroblast, and immune cells, and also with non-cellular components, it follows that cell motility in tumor microenvironments, especially metastasis via the invasion of cancer cells into the extracellular matrix and other tissues, is closely related to the malignancy of cancer-related mortality. Medical relevance of forefront research realized in microfabricated devices, such as single cell sorting based on the analysis of cell migration behavior, may assist personalized theragnostics based on the cell migration phenotype.

We first introduce key findings in cancer cell migration under the influence of the physical environment, which is systematically controlled by microengineering technology, followed by multi-cues of physico-chemical factors, which represent the complexity of the tumor environment. Recognizing that cancer cells constantly communicate not only with each other but also with tumor-associated cells such as vascular, fibroblast, and immune cells, and also with non-cellular components, it follows that cell motility in tumor microenvironments, especially metastasis via the invasion of cancer cells into the extracellular matrix and other tissues, is closely related to the malignancy of cancer-related mortality. Medical relevance of forefront research realized in microfabricated devices, such as single cell sorting based on the analysis of cell migration behavior, may assist personalized theragnostics based on the cell migration phenotype. Furthermore, we urge development of theory and numerical understanding of single or collective cell migration in microengineered platforms to gain new insights in cancer metastasis and in therapeutic strategies.',\n",

However, for most European universities, it is a rather new phenomenon. The purpose of the work is to analyse scientific literature on European higher education programmes for international students and to outline a theoretical framework of European higher education programmes for international students underpinning elaboration of new research question on master programmes for international engineering students. The research methodology comprises the study of the meaning of the key concepts of \"framework\", \"theoretical framework\" and \"international students\". Moreover, the logical chain of analysis is shown: theoretical framework → empirical study within a multicultural environment → conclusions. The case study research is applied. The empirical study was carried out at Hochschule Wismar, Germany in March 2017. Semi-structured interview served as the basis for data collection.

       "  'description': 'Hochschule Wismar, Germany, has been implementing Master programmes for international students since 1992. However, for most European universities, it is a rather new phenomenon. The purpose of the work is to analyse scientific literature on European higher education programmes for international students and to outline a theoretical framework of European higher education programmes for international students underpinning elaboration of new research question on master programmes for international engineering students. The research methodology comprises the study of the meaning of the key concepts of \"framework\", \"theoretical framework\" and \"international students\". Moreover, the logical chain of analysis is shown: theoretical framework → empirical study within a multicultural environment → conclusions. The case study research is applied. The empirical study was carried out at Hochschule Wismar, Germany in March 2017. Semi-structured interview served as the basis for data collection. The empirical findings allow complementing the elaborated theoretical framework consisting of the concepts on reasons for, language and impact of Masetr programme for international students with such a concept as European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). Directions of further research are proposed. The novel contribution of the paper is the newly formulated research question on master programmes for international students.',\n",

The research was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Nuclear Safety Standards Commission. The aim of the analysis was to examine the fire damper with respect to its resistance to service loadings, structural integrity, and capability to stay operative after an earthquake. The analysis was carried out using the Finite Element Method in LS-Dyna software. The earthquake loading was modelled as accelerations, measured in three directions during the earthquake. For modelling of the materials behaviour, material models taking into account the influence of strain rate on hardening were used. The analysis consisted of three stages, which were: loading the construction with the earth gravity, earthquake simulation by loading with accelerations in three directions, and, finally, closing the fire damper. The analysis has shown that some of the construction elements undergo plastic deformations. However, the performed simulation of fire damper closing showed that despite these deformations, the device remains capable to keep its functionality and the damper closes hermetically. The results of the analysis were important design indications for the fire damper prototype.',\n",

The study shows that organic matters are conducive to the precipitation of calcium carbonate, mainly in terms of benthic stickknot, planktonic bonding and biological particles to form carbonate. Organic matters can promote the formation of the organic-iron complex, and the micro environment formed during organic matters thermal evolution can promote metasomatism of carbonate minerals by pyrite. During the burial, organic matters produce organic acids, which may cause the dissolution and recrystallization of calcite, and further control the calcite crystal size and conformation. Organic matters can generate abundant storage pores directly or indirectly, which is very important for the formation of pore networks in the shale and for the reservoir physical properties. The analyses show that the shale oil production is closely related to the TOC content, which increases simultaneously with the TOC content. The study suggests that for the shale reservoir formation and industry capacity, the lower limit of TOC content is 2%, and an effective thickness of organic-rich shale needs to be reached.

The outer conduit is mechanically optimized by manipulating crosslinking and collagen density, allowing the engineering of a high wall permeability to mitigate the risk of neuroma formation, while also maintaining physiologically relevant stiffness and enzymatic degradation tuned to coincide with regeneration rates. Freeze-drying is used to seamlessly integrate the luminal filler into the conduit, creating a longitudinally aligned pore microarchitecture.

KGaA, WeinheimThis study reports the development of a bilayered scaffold with aligned channels produced via a sequential coextrusion and unidirectional freezing process to facilitate upward bone-marrow stem-cell migration. The biomimetic scaffold with collagen and biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) layers is successfully fabricated with matching of the cartilage and bone layers. The aligned structure results in an enhancement of the compressive strength, and the channels enable tight anchoring of the collagen layers on the BCP scaffolds compared with a randomly structured porous scaffold. An in vitro evaluation demonstrates that the aligned channels guide the cells to attach on the surface in highly stretched shapes and migrate upward faster than the random structure. In addition, in vivo assessment reveals that the aligned channels yield superior osteochondral tissue regeneration compared with the random structure. Moreover, the channel diameter greatly affects the tissue regeneration, and the scaffold with a channel diameter of ≈270 µm exhibits the optimal regeneration because of sufficient nutrient supply and adequate tissue ingrowth. These findings indicate that the introduction of aligned channels to a bilayered scaffold provides an effective approach for osteochondral tissue regeneration.',\n",

KGaA, WeinheimDelivery of genetically modified cells overexpressing Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a promising approach to induce therapeutic angiogenesis in ischemic tissues. The effect of the protein is strictly modulated by its interaction with the components of the extracellular matrix. Its therapeutic potential depends on a sustained but controlled release at the microenvironmental level in order to avoid the formation of abnormal blood vessels. In this study, it is hypothesized that the composition of the scaffold plays a key role in modulating the binding, hence the therapeutic effect, of the VEGF released by 3D-cell constructs. It is found that collagen sponges, which poorly bind VEGF, prevent the formation of localized hot spots of excessive concentration, therefore, precluding the development of aberrant angiogenesis despite uncontrolled expression by a genetically engineered population of adipose tissue-derived stromal cells. On the contrary, after seeding on VEGF-binding egg-white scaffolds, the same cell population caused aberrantly enlarged vascular structures after 14 d.

It is essential to further quantify bottom contact, given that contact made by commercial fishing gear with the benthos is considered one of the most significant human impacts on the oceanic environment. There are several devices that measure bottom contact; these devices, however, usually address only one point of contact, such as the center of the footrope, when other components of the fishing gear may be making contact as well.

Knowledge of these remote areas is uneven, derived from mostly uncoordinated surveys and sampling expeditions by surface vessels, exploration with remotely operated vehicles (ROV), and streaming data from a cabled scientific observatory operated by Ocean Networks Canada (ONC). The area currently includes two Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), managed by Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), at Bowie Seamount and the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents. The great depth (2200-2400 metres) and 250 km offshore distance of the Endeavour MPA, together with the habitat heterogeneity that is typical of volcanic ridges, present challenges to effective monitoring and management. The installation of cabled observatory infrastructure within the Endeavour MPA in 2009 provided an opportunity for remote monitoring of environmental variability. In 2014, ONC partnered with DFO to develop spatial management tools for the Endeavour MPA. Combining observatory sensor data with observations made during maintenance and research expeditions can provide insight into natural variability and human disturbance, and assist in the management and preservation of the MPA. Such an approach can also provide a knowledge base for understanding stressors and support the implementation of risk-based management. The partnership between DFO and ONC was expanded in 2016 to include other offshore areas within the now established Pacific Offshore Area of Interest. Geodatabases were developed using ESRI Geographical Information System (GIS) software for the Endeavour MPA, and three other offshore locations served by ONC's cabled observatory network: The Middle Valley hydrothermal fields, the Cascadia Basin abyssal plain, and the Nootka Fault Zone. All geodatabases integrate available data from ONC's Oceans 2.0 data management system, DFO and third party cruise data, and relevant publications. Data include bathymetry, links to annotated ROV dive videos, underwater vehicle tracks, sampling activity records, and observations of biological and geographical features. The GIS also links observations to the time-correlated ROV dive videos using ONC's SeaTube video viewing tool, allowing for further more detailed analysis. Spatial statistics tools are applied to ROV tracks and sample sites to produce heat maps highlighting well-studied (and heavily-used) areas and those with little knowledge base. The end result is a geospatial database and toolkit that can integrate many data types, and support integrated management of remote and dynamic seafloor habitats.\",\n",

The great depth (2200-2400 metres) and 250 km offshore distance of the Endeavour MPA, together with the habitat heterogeneity that is typical of volcanic ridges, present challenges to effective monitoring and management. The installation of cabled observatory infrastructure within the Endeavour MPA in 2009 provided an opportunity for remote monitoring of environmental variability. In 2014, ONC partnered with DFO to develop spatial management tools for the Endeavour MPA. Combining observatory sensor data with observations made during maintenance and research expeditions can provide insight into natural variability and human disturbance, and assist in the management and preservation of the MPA. Such an approach can also provide a knowledge base for understanding stressors and support the implementation of risk-based management. The partnership between DFO and ONC was expanded in 2016 to include other offshore areas within the now established Pacific Offshore Area of Interest. Geodatabases were developed using ESRI Geographical Information System (GIS) software for the Endeavour MPA, and three other offshore locations served by ONC's cabled observatory network: The Middle Valley hydrothermal fields, the Cascadia Basin abyssal plain, and the Nootka Fault Zone. All geodatabases integrate available data from ONC's Oceans 2.0 data management system, DFO and third party cruise data, and relevant publications. Data include bathymetry, links to annotated ROV dive videos, underwater vehicle tracks, sampling activity records, and observations of biological and geographical features. The GIS also links observations to the time-correlated ROV dive videos using ONC's SeaTube video viewing tool, allowing for further more detailed analysis. Spatial statistics tools are applied to ROV tracks and sample sites to produce heat maps highlighting well-studied (and heavily-used) areas and those with little knowledge base. The end result is a geospatial database and toolkit that can integrate many data types, and support integrated management of remote and dynamic seafloor habitats.\",\n",

Various field tests and commercial projects have been conducted using autonomous vehicles as platforms, each towing a 3DSA. Often, these have been deployed during ongoing traditional seismic surveys, thus allowing the possibility of making direct comparisons of operations flexibility and data. The objectives of this project were to • Assess the feasibility of seismic acquisition using AVs and 3DSA, including safe deployment and retrieval • Evaluate the performance of the 3DSA based on holding station capability, maintenance of desired depth, and accuracy of measurements of pitch and orientation • Compare the quality of the acquired seismic data with the pressure data recorded in the traditional surveys Marine seismic data are normally acquired using towed-streamer arrays, ocean-bottom cables (OBC), or ocean-bottom nodes (OBN) where the receivers are in fixed positions on the seafloor. Towed streamer-acquisition is the predominant method of marine acquisition because it is highly efficient and easy to implement. Narrow-azimuth (NAZ) streamer acquisition geometries typically acquire good-quality seismic data in noncomplex geologic environments and have a very well-established processing methodology. However, water depth, seafloor topography, or operational constraints due to in-situ infrastructure and obstructions can make acquiring data using these methods difficult and could result in a decrease in operational efficiency, which would increase acquisition cost or result in poor or zero data coverage. For seismic applications, the 3DSA consists of 15 hydrophones (3 in each of the five arms) mounted on a frame approximately 1.5 m in size. A buoyancy engine just below the top arm ensures that this arm remains on the high side and that the entire array is oriented and does not rotate on its axis while moving through the water.

Under standard conditions, theoretical cell voltages provided by aluminum and magnesium can be calculated to be 1.26V and 1.97V respectively (comparable to a typical alkaline battery cell at 1.5V). Similarly, theoretical voltages for sediment microbial fuel cells have been estimated on the order of 1V based on standard conditions. These theoretical voltages do not account for losses or differences due to environmental conditions, transport, electrodes, or cell design. Engineering these systems to minimize losses can focus on many different aspects of system design. We focus here on the cathode, in part because improvements in oxygen reduction could be applicable to both abiotic metal battery systems as well as the biological fuel cell system. Our approach here is to analyze the performance of the cathode using electrochemical and molecular biology techniques. Employing these techniques is important to obtain a more complete understanding of the cathode because of the typical biomass growth that must be accounted for on exposed electrode surfaces. In most prototype systems, cathode materials use inert materials such as carbon or stainless steel. In this study, we look at three common-place carbon materials, graphite plates, graphite fiber brushes, and carbon cloth, and their performance as cathode substrates in undersea power systems. A major driving force behind this study was the availability of these materials for large scale applications in the future. Additional consideration was given to past use in published field studies with primary batteries (aluminum, magnesium) or in microbial fuel cell systems. For this reason, we report here the performance of undersea cathodes through operation and electrochemical testing in a sediment microbial fuel cell system. The effect of oxygen concentration on performance was evaluated and a minimum dissolved oxygen concentration of about 3 mg/L was determined for proper function at cathodes. Electrochemical studies indicate two distinct processes taking place at the cathode surface. We also take an exploratory look at the microbial community supported on each of these materials. An examination of typical cathode microbial communities offers some mechanisms that could be used to improve abiotic cathodes through use of metal catalysts based on iron or manganese.

This paper describes a new system that utilizes low-cost battery and solar powered transponders for both terrestrial and satellite AIS (dual-mode) messaging, and specialized algorithms and software, to provide an affordable and practical solution to reliably track small boats. Methods have been implemented, preliminary results have been collected and additional sea trials are currently underway.\",\n",

We performed the first study on comparing private modes in popular desktop and mobile browsers and found many inconsistencies between different browsers and between the desktop and mobile versions of the same browser. We show that some inconsistencies result from the tradeoff between security and privacy.

Because the diameter of thin catheters is less than 500 μm, the conventional guide wire is useless in blood vessels smaller than 1 mm. Thus, we have experimented the performance bending the thin catheter considering the spatial distribution of acoustic field. However, there was a problem of accurate positioning of ultrasound source that induces the thin catheter to the target position in blood vessels from the body surface. To address this issue, robotic positioning of therapeutic devices on body surface is required. For this purpose, we have modified our robotic system including a parallel link robot, which has both the diagnostic probe and the therapeutic transducer. In this paper, first, we describe the overview of the system to evaluate the position accuracy using a needle insertion experiment, where the accuracy was about 1.5 mm. Then, we demonstrated an induction experiment of the thin catheter induction using the bifurcation point in an artificial blood vessel.

Most children with autism had increased connectivity in the short/medium-range, especially from the left side of the frontal and temporal cortices to brain areas in the right and central cortices (f7-C4, T3-C4, and T5-C4; p < 0.01). We also found a slight trend for children with autism to have decreased coherence in long-range synchrony between left frontal and occipital sites (F3-O1, p < 0.05). We concluded that EEG performed using sedation to promote deep sleep can be used to find brain abnormalities in children with autism. We also suspect that the occurrence of synchrony abnormalities is strongly related to developmental brain disorders in the autistic brain. This may especially be true for abnormalities in connections between central and temporal sites in low-frequency bands (delta and theta bands).',\n",

The proposed algorithm was tested on twenty-eight passport-type images with different background using in Intel i5 processor (1.80 GHz) with 4 GB RAM and 500 GB hard disk. According to the analysis, the execution time of the modified sectional thresholding method is 1.5 times faster than the traditional one.',\n",

This method requires only three electrodes and a short period of data collection (1 min). Experimental results show that Alzheimer's disease is identified with over 70% accuracy. Therefore, this Alzheimer's disease detection system appears to be feasible.\",\n",

First, a lipid bilayer was formed between the surface of a hydrogel and a buffer solution with the contact method. Since the hydrogel supported the bilayer, stability is expected to be improved. Capacitance measurements evaluated the bilayer formation with an electrophysiological setup. The amplitude of the current responses reached up to 160 pA, suggesting that the surface area of the bilayer was approximately 8.3 × 103 μm2 (diameter of 50 μm). Second, the lipid bilayer was formed on patterned agarose using the self-spreading method. In this situation, the agarose works as a spacer between the membrane and substrate. Membrane formation was evaluated with fluorescence recovery after the photo bleaching method. Third, for future studies with membrane proteins, liposome formation was evaluated in various conditions, and we confirmed that liposomes could be formed in an in vitro protein synthesis solution.',\n",

The proposed scheme acquires initial boundaries and edges in advance, and then divides boundary into small edges according to key vertices on boundaries.

This paper introduces a scheme to reify an object based on law of closure in Gestalt psychology. The proposed scheme acquires initial boundaries and edges in advance, and then divides boundary into small edges according to key vertices on boundaries. Applying approximate line and approximate ellipse/circle to two edges, it determines whether two edges are highly related to each other or not. Consequently, path searching is implemented on all edges to find closed loop as well as to construct object with completion contour.',\n",

This paper proposes a framework for the development of a mobile application that enhances information dissemination of local community officials and its residents in times of disasters. Real-time information reports will improve response time and rescue. With an updated database of residents as its main users, their safety could be monitored through a safety check poll. The main feature takes advantage of crowd sourcing concepts. Capitalizing on the capability of smartphones geolocation capabilities, pinpointing precise location of users is simplified. Data gathered from past occurrences can be used for risk reduction planning and implementation of disaster preparedness and response activities. The Zone 44 of Sampaloc, Manila Philippines is the initial focus of implementation testing.',\n",

However, the implementation and research, at least in Ecuador; has been very complex due to two problems: (1) organization in the design and the integration of the components and applications when participate several researchers and engineers of multiple disciplines (e.g, control, software) and (2) the complex implementation due to the technological fragmentation between the military contexts (e.g., air force, army and navy). We propose an approach to the solution to the implementation of real-time military health monitoring in combat missions, using the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm and the research model proposed by Takeuchi & Nonaka. We were able to obtain a meta-model delineated in the 4 domains of the IoT Technology embedded within the 4 contexts of a product line process. The meta-model has solved the problem associated with implementation as a product line while had increasing the comprehensibility between researchers and engineers.',\n",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Respiratory activity is an essential vital sign of life that can indicate changes in typical breathing patterns and irregular body functions such as asthma and panic attacks. Many times, there is a need to monitor breathing activity while performing day-to-day functions such as standing, bending, trunk stretching or during yoga exercises. A single IMU (inertial measurement unit) can be used in measuring respiratory motion; however, breathing motion data may be influenced by a body trunk movement that occurs while recording respiratory activity. This research employs a pair of wireless, wearable IMU sensors custom-made by the Department of Electrical Engineering at San Diego State University. After appropriate sensor placement for data collection, this research applies principles of robotics, using the Denavit-Hartenberg convention, to extract relative angular motion between the two sensors. One of the obtained relative joint angles in the “Sagittal” plane predominantly yields respiratory activity.

Many times, there is a need to monitor breathing activity while performing day-to-day functions such as standing, bending, trunk stretching or during yoga exercises. A single IMU (inertial measurement unit) can be used in measuring respiratory motion; however, breathing motion data may be influenced by a body trunk movement that occurs while recording respiratory activity. This research employs a pair of wireless, wearable IMU sensors custom-made by the Department of Electrical Engineering at San Diego State University. After appropriate sensor placement for data collection, this research applies principles of robotics, using the Denavit-Hartenberg convention, to extract relative angular motion between the two sensors. One of the obtained relative joint angles in the “Sagittal” plane predominantly yields respiratory activity. An improvised version of the proposed method and wearable, wireless sensors can be suitable to extract respiratory information while performing sports or exercises, as they do not restrict body motion or the choice of location to gather data.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': \"© 2013 IEEE.In this paper, we proposed an upper-limb post-stroke rehabilitation system integrating a motion tracking device (MTD), a portable electroencephalogram (EEG) device for an attentional feedback, and interactive virtual reality (VR) game with the goal to assist patients in upper-limb rehabilitation. Fifteen post-stroke patients were recruited and randomly assigned to a control group (A) or one of two experimental groups (B and C). Group B played the game using a MTD and group C played it using a MTD and brain-computer-interface-based attention-monitoring EEG device. In group C, patients' attention was measured in real time using the EEG while the patients performed tasks; visual and auditory stimuli were emitted when their attention lowered. The primary outcome was a change in score on the upper extremity section of the Fugl-Meyer assessment, which was used to evaluate the severity of motor impairment and indicate any improvement of motor function. Improvement in motor function, associated with game performance, was found in group C. Based on their performance quality during 12 training sessions, the higher performance of group C patients in the VR game was significantly correlated with attention level and motor performance. Higher attention level is associated with higher game performance after 12 training sessions, and our MTD-EEG-VR training system may facilitate the improvement of motor function and assist patients in upper-limb rehabilitation. Our MTD-EEG-VR game with the attentional EEG-feedback device is a potential intervention for improving motor function in patients with stroke.\",\n",

All right reserved.The systematic investigation on the strength and environmental safety properties of the SPB and SPC stabilized soil is presented in this paper. The field soil which has been industrial contaminated with nickel(Ni) and zinc(Zn) is studied. The SPB binder is composed of superphosphate and cement-activated steel slag and the SPC binder is composed of superphosphate and quicklime. The stabilized soils were tested for the unconfined compression strength, dry density, soil pH, acid neutralization capacity, toxic leaching characteristics and contaminant speciation varying with dosages and curing periods. The results demonstrate that the addition of two binders increases the unconfined compressive strength and soil pH, but reduces the toxicity leaching concentration of Ni and Zn. These results are interpreted based on the variations in chemical speciation of Ni and Zn and the capacity index of acid buffer of the stabilized soils. It was also found that the SPC stabilized soil had a lower pH value than that of PC under curing of 28 days. The SPC shows higher immobilization efficiency than PC at early curing.

All right reserved.In order to obtain the reasonable layout of roadways in the upper coal seam, the morphology characteristics of fractured zone and the concentrated stress distribution in surrounding rock induced by the mining of lower coal seam were studied with the methods of theoretical analysis, field testing and numerical simulation. This study was based on the upward mining of #2 and #4 close coal seams in No. 6 mining district of Zhaizhen mine. The results showed that the fractured zone was developed upward with the strata group as a unit under the condition of overlying composite strata structure and this forming mechanism was also verified in the field testing. The spatial morphology of fractured zone presented an irregular saddle shape tilted to the inside of the goaf with a boundary angle of approximately 75°-78°.

The roadway set in this areas is feasible. According to the results of numerical simulation, the broken position of the upper #2 seam was about 3-5m on the goaf side, and the range of internal stress field was 6-10 m on the goaf side.

It is difficult for plant to survive under these unfavorable conditions which cause an unprecedented number of fungal and fungal-like diseases which are the most common kind of plant disease. Various approaches such as use of chemical pesticides and other synthetic molecules have been used to control the fungal infections in crop plants. Different transgenic plants have been developed by introducing various genes responsible for resistance in opposition to fungal pathogens. Genes of the enzymes responsible for cell wall degradation are frequently applied to generate transgenic plants for fungal resistance. This chapter mainly emphasizes on how transgenic approach helps to confer plant resistance toward fungal diseases.',\n",

Studies about the relationships between runoff, sediment reduction, nutrient losses and soil physicochemical properties under soil and water conservation measures have been fully reported. However, most of the studies were conducted under a single soil and water conservation measure.

Long term in situ observation in the standard citrus orchard plots was carried out to investigate the runoff, sediment and nutrient losses under different plant measures, cultivation measures and engineering measures and their effects on the soil physical and chemical properties. Six standard runoff plots with same slopes were selected as experimental plots. The sizes of the plots were 5 m (width) × 20 m (length). The horizontal projection areas and slopes of the plots were 100 m2 and 12°, respectively. Three rectangular pools were built in each plot. Twelve citrus trees were planted in each plot. A plot was selected as the control plot with planted citrus trees only. Different plant measures, tillage measures, engineering+plant measures and engineering measures were adopted in the other five plots. The average annual runoff reduction benefits of different measures were ranked in the order: plant measures > engineering + plant measures > tillage measures> engineering measures.

       "  'abstracts': '© 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All right reserved.Ultrasonic flowmeter is a non-contact flow measurement method which is widely used in various regions from agricultural irrigation to food processing. The accuracy and stability of ultrasonic flowmeter can be affected by large scale vortex because the measurement basically depends on average line velocity on the ultrasonic path rather than the whole intersection scanning. For U-shape transit-time ultrasonic flowmeter, the reflection columns extend into flow area and generate vortexes. The influence on the ultrasonic measurement from different scale vortexes is known as turbulence error. By using constriction design, commercial ultrasonic flowmeters can reduce the unfavorable impact of turbulence fluctuation and then increase its signal to noise ratio (SNR). But the pressure loss caused by the necking design is correspondingly large. In order to replace the constriction and keep applicable measurement accuracy, the discussion on the sources and correction of different measurement errors of ultrasonic flowmeter is emphasized. This paper developed a numerical simulation model for ultrasonic flowmeter based on the large eddy simulation (LES) theory and also validated it. Upon the obtained LES data, the frequency spectrum analyses are firstly practiced to study the relationship between measurement accuracy and turbulent diffusion on the basic U-shape ultrasonic flowmeter without optimization. It is found that the mean flow rate at the second half of flowmeter is relatively high and the turbulent fluctuating scale is comparatively large. Breaking the large scale vortexes at the second half is probably a good way to stabilize the turbulent fluctuation. This manuscript designed three new types of U-shape ultrasonic flowmeters with grid structure, which canceled the constriction part in the U-shape ultrasonic flowmeter. The statistical characteristics of turbulent error based on 6 different U-shape ultrasonic flowmeters are compared. The best optimized design is Case 3 which can potentially replace the U-shape ultrasonic flowmeter with constriction design due to low pressure loss. It can be found that, compared to the ultrasonic flowmeter with constriction, Case 3 reduces the pressure loss by 55% and 61% under the Reynolds number of 5 000 and 50 000 respectively. The turbulent error of Case 3 under the Reynolds number of 5 000 is 0.01%, which is as small as U-shape ultrasonic flowmeter with constriction. As for large flow rate under the Reynolds number of 50 000, the turbulent errors of Case 3 and U-shape ultrasonic flowmeter with constriction are very close, which are 0.18% and 0.17%, respectively. In order to analyze the turbulence reducing effects of Case 3, the flow characteristics of Case 3 is studied. The distribution of grid structure of Case 3 has little influence on the averaged velocity in the measured path. The velocity in Case 3 is layered without good mixing, which can be regarded as the sign of less large scale fluctuation. The introduction of grid structure can restrict the low frequency pulsation, while increasing the high frequency components. As the high frequency components are easier to be smoothed out by time average, the ultrasonic measurement is optimized.

       "  'abstracts': \"© 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All right reserved.Agricultural product safety concerns the national economy and the people's livelihood. From the starting point of agriculture production, the quality and safety of products, i.e. seeds, are especially important and need to be traced. To realize the traceability of crop seeds and help the production enterprise to analyze the operation status and realize the interactive marketing, in this paper, we constructed a bidirectional dynamic model of seed traceability based on location analysis. Through the seed electronic code, the model divided the traditional logistics information chain data into different sets of geographic codes, which were nested according to the geographical location of the distribution. The commodity seed from the factory to the user will experience a lot of path node, each path node dealer was required to writes its own geographic code. The geographic code contained the company information of the dealers at all levels and the place name information of the sale's area. In the pre-sale stage of the seed, the geographic code set information was independent of each other. When the end user queried the seed electronic code, the flag was activated and the model started to dynamically analyze the location of the user. By converting the user's latitude and longitude information, this model received the detailed address information, started match the geographical code set of information from small to large, and ultimately found the dealer information or returned warning information. The query action of the user connected the geographical code sets of all levels, and the whole traceability data chain provided the traceability result to both the enterprise and the user at this time. The enterprise-side model consisted of a collection layer, a data sharing analysis layer, and an application presentation layer. When the enterprise obtained the traceability information, it can communicate with users, collecting user's behavior data, and pushing enterprise marketing information. The enterprise-side model can be combined with supply chain data for data analysis to help improve and guide production. By selecting the data of sales and feedback of Huacheng 3366 wheat in ten counties, the goodness-of-fit was 0.997 8, which showed that the feedback from the code scanning could promote the sales. Among all the 14 092 barcode scanning position information, only 21 of them cannot be converted into the appropriate place name fields, and the model geo-code position conversion rate was around 99.851%, which can basically meet the business requirements of collecting and analyzing feedback information, helped enterprise effectively avoid the risk of transregional behavior. During the 36 months of trial operation, the monthly average number of server downtime was about 0.27 times, and the safe running days ratio was 99.087%, which can meet the requirements of enterprise traceability stability. The model was layered and independent of circulation information, which ensured the integrity, authenticity and security of traceability. The model added the bidirectional interactive data link on the traditional traceability model, so that the enterprise can interact with the user when scanning and obtain the user behavior data and push the marketing information. The model's commissioning of the geocode location conversion rate, the number of days, the site safe operation and other technical indicators can effectively help companies master the actual operation, effectively prevent the occurrence of the transregional behavior, optimize the enterprise distribution channels, it also provides a more reliable means of information for the regulatory department to manage the seed market.\",\n",

The query action of the user connected the geographical code sets of all levels, and the whole traceability data chain provided the traceability result to both the enterprise and the user at this time. The enterprise-side model consisted of a collection layer, a data sharing analysis layer, and an application presentation layer. When the enterprise obtained the traceability information, it can communicate with users, collecting user's behavior data, and pushing enterprise marketing information. The enterprise-side model can be combined with supply chain data for data analysis to help improve and guide production. By selecting the data of sales and feedback of Huacheng 3366 wheat in ten counties, the goodness-of-fit was 0.997 8, which showed that the feedback from the code scanning could promote the sales. Among all the 14 092 barcode scanning position information, only 21 of them cannot be converted into the appropriate place name fields, and the model geo-code position conversion rate was around 99.851%, which can basically meet the business requirements of collecting and analyzing feedback information, helped enterprise effectively avoid the risk of transregional behavior. During the 36 months of trial operation, the monthly average number of server downtime was about 0.27 times, and the safe running days ratio was 99.087%, which can meet the requirements of enterprise traceability stability. The model was layered and independent of circulation information, which ensured the integrity, authenticity and security of traceability. The model added the bidirectional interactive data link on the traditional traceability model, so that the enterprise can interact with the user when scanning and obtain the user behavior data and push the marketing information. The model's commissioning of the geocode location conversion rate, the number of days, the site safe operation and other technical indicators can effectively help companies master the actual operation, effectively prevent the occurrence of the transregional behavior, optimize the enterprise distribution channels, it also provides a more reliable means of information for the regulatory department to manage the seed market.\",\n",

It also describes in great detail many practices and techniques used by recording and mixing engineers, including video production and computers. This book is meant for intermediate to advanced recording engineers and audiophiles who want to become experts. There's plenty for beginners too. One unique feature is explaining how audio devices such as equalizers, compressors, and A/D converters work internally, and how they're spec'd and tested, rather than merely describing how to use them. There's plenty of myth-busting and consumerism too. The book doesn't tell readers what brand power amplifier to buy, but it explains in great detail what defines a good amplifier so people can choose a first-rate model wisely without over-paying.

       "  'abstracts': '© 2013 IEEE.In many real-world applications, labeled instances are generally limited and expensively collected, while the most instances are unlabeled and the amount is often sufficient. Therefore, semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted much attention, since it is an effective tool to discover the unlabeled instances. However, how to safely make use of the unlabeled instances is an emerging and interesting problem in SSL. Hence, we propose DuAL Learning-based sAfe Semi-supervised learning (DALLAS), which employs dual learning to estimate the safety or risk of the unlabeled instances. To realize the safe exploitation of the unlabeled instances, our basic idea is to use supervised learning (SL) to analyze the risk of the unlabeled instances. First, DALLAS utilizes a primal model obtained by dual learning to classify each unlabeled instance and then uses a dual model to reconstruct the unlabeled instances according to the obtained classification results. The risk can be measured by analyzing the reconstruction error and predictions of the original and reconstructed unlabeled instances. If the error is small and the predictions are equal, the unlabeled instance may be safe. Otherwise, the instance may be risky and its output should be approach to be that obtained by SL. Finally, we embed a risk-based regularization term into SSL. Hence, the outputs of our algorithm are a tradeoff between those of SL and SSL. In particular, we utilize respectively regularized least squares (RLS) and Laplacian RLS for SL and SSL. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed safe mechanism in DALLAS, we carry out a series of experiments on several data sets by the comparison with the state-of-the-art supervised, semi-supervised, and safe semi-supervised learning methods and the results demonstrate that DALLAS can effectively reduce the risk of the unlabeled instances.',\n",

The present work sought to alleviate the \"expression level\" barrier upon placing the isoprene synthase (IspS) enzyme in different fusion configurations with the cpcB protein, the highly expressed β-subunit of phycocyanin. Different cpcB∗IspS fusion constructs were made, distinguished by the absence or presence of linker amino acids between the two proteins. Composition of linker amino acids was variable with lengths of 7, 10, 16, and 65 amino acids designed to test for optimal activity of the IspS through spatial positioning between the cpcB and IspS. Results showed that fusion constructs with the highly expressed cpcB gene, as the leader sequence, improved transgene expression in the range of 61 to 275-fold over what was measured with the unfused IspS control. However, the specific activity of the IspS enzyme was attenuated in all fusion transformants, possibly because of allosteric effects exerted by the leader cpcB fusion protein. This inhibition varied depending on the nature of the linker amino acids between the cpcB and IspS proteins. In terms of isoprene production, the results further showed a trade-off between specific activity and transgenic enzyme accumulation. For example, the cpcB∗L7∗IspS strain showed only about 10% the isoprene synthase specific-activity of the unfused cpcB-IspS control, but it accumulated 254-fold more IspS enzyme. The latter more than countered the slower specific activity and made the cpcB∗L7∗IspS transformant the best isoprene producing strain in this work.

We leverage the database to identify promising bioengineering targets by searching globally across multiple stress conditions as well as by narrowing the focus to fewer conditions of interest, such as biofuel stress and antibiotic stress. We discuss some of the most frequently differentially expressed or coexpressed genes, and predict which transcription factors and sigma factors most likely contribute to gene expression profiles in a wide array of conditions.

The building provides an archetype for modern details of cold-formed steel construction, and provides benchmarks for the seismic response of the building system, subsystem, and components. The seismic response of buildings framed from cold-formed steel has seen little study in comparison with efforts on isolated members and shear walls. Validated building-scale models are needed to expand our understanding of the seismic response of these systems. Finite element models corresponding to the archetype building during its various test phases are developed in OpenSees and detailed herein. For cold-formed steel framed buildings accurate seismic models require consideration of components beyond the isolated shear walls, e.g. the stiffness and capacity of the gravity framing is included in the model. Such decisions require model refinement beyond what is typically performed and details for completing this effort accurately and efficiently are described herein. In addition, nonstructural components, including exterior sheathing of the gravity framing, interior gypsum sheathing for the shear walls and gravity framing, and interior partition walls, are included in the building model based on nonlinear surrogate models that utilize experimental characterization of member-fastener-sheathing response. Comparisons between the developed models and testing for natural period, story drift, accelerations, and foundation hold-down forces validate the model.

We assess the changes in safety and fitness for purpose of domestic natural gas appliances when supplied with natural gas/hydrogen mixtures.

Comparing the changes in Wobbe Index and variations in burning velocity with those experienced by domestic appliances subjected to the range of natural gases ordinarily distributed to the end user provides an unambiguous and internally consistent method to assess changes in essential performance upon hydrogen addition. Thus, limits on hydrogen addition can be derived to maintain the current level of safety and fitness for purpose without the necessity of large-scale appliance testing.

Finally, a design procedure by connecting particle swarm optimization technique with the present FE analysis is created to reduce the deformations of simply supported composite beams while the quantity of shear connectors remains the same, to prove the superior simulation capacity and efficiency of the derived FE stiffness matrix with other techniques. Compared to the analytical methods, the proposed finite element is more convenient and applicable in the analysis of partial-interaction composite beams under more complicated loading and boundary conditions. In the meantime, the explicitly expressed local stiffness matrix can be easily implemented into other commercial software packages as a subroutine for both professional and personal engineering designs and calculations.\",\n",

In this work, PLA tubes were extruded using CO2 as a foaming agent. The foaming of the PLA tubes at various extruder screw rotational speed and different CO2 pressure are studied in this work. Subsequently, morphological characterization and surface hydrophilicity studies of the tubes were carried out.

This composite realized obvious improvements in both the mechanical property (fracture strength and fracture strain) and the water swelling ability, with values of 2.97, 1.41 and 4.08 times, respectively, those of pure BC, as well as a high and prolonged antibacterial effect for more than 48 h.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': \"© 2016 Elsevier LtdThe purpose of this article is to determine what legal design opportunities exist to accommodate legally disruptive experiments that are concerned with technological and/or governance innovation towards enhanced sustainability, with a smart energy system focus of application. The legal design approach is used to clarify types of general legal frames (or regimes); frames that create a legal space that provides either exceptional legal permissions and/or legal abilities for experimentation. As results of the analysis in this article bring to light that there are two main types of legal frameworks for experimentation. The first is experimentation by exceptional derogation from existing legal rules in the hope that experimental findings may lead to cleaner practices accommodated by adjusted legal rules. The case of the Dutch regime for experimenting with prosumerism in smart energy grids is used as an example of this type. The second type is that of experimentation by devolution, whereby a distributed variation of approaches to a similar policy challenge is allowed within a broader framework that holds guidelines for relevant epistemic and legal concerns. The case of the EU Renewable energy directive is used as an example. The functioning of both types of experiments is placed in the context of collective action challenges, using the ILTIAD-framework for analysis and design, which combines Ostrom's IAD-framework and Institutional Legal Theory. The main conclusions of this article are that we need to carefully understand the different types of legal regimes for experimentation, especially in relation to normative positions, types of legal abilities and permissions. Further, it becomes clear that guidelines are needed as regards both epistemic values, on the issues of experimental safety and on safeguarding that experimental results are properly evaluated, and legal values, such as on the issue of precaution, legal certainty and legal equality. Finally, the analysis in this article underscores the importance of experimentation (by devolution and/or derogation) as a mechanism of collective action feedbacks towards innovation of law, governance and technology, such as in the area of the energy transition.\",\n",

       "  'abstracts': \"© 2016 Elsevier LtdThis study addresses research demands for a more critical empirical assessment of the innovation capacity of the decentralised, sub-national level. In Germany, the extensive involvement and contributions of new locally-rooted renewable energy initiatives have been one of the most striking features of the country's energy transition process. This study analyses the enabling conditions, current challenges and future prospects of decentralised experimentation in the German energy system. It finds that whereas the national support scheme has for a long period protected decentralised deployment of renewable energies by locally-rooted actors in the energy field, recent reforms of the scheme now threaten their further participation in the energy market. The paper observes that decentralised initiatives not only struggle to adjust to the new framework conditions. They have also not yet sufficiently addressed the new governance challenges arising from the fact that renewable energies have reached a stage of systemic importance for the whole power system, which requires decentralised initiatives to make their own efforts compatible with overall energy system transition needs. The study concludes that in order to remain an important innovator in the German energy transition, decentralised initiatives have to prove their ability to provide solutions to the systemic challenges of the energy transition process, such as horizontal and vertical multi-level coordination and decentralised contributions to the security of supply.\",\n",

In order to investigate this relationship, a biomimetic esophageal swallowing robot has been developed that can transport boluses in a continuous peristaltic manner. In swallowing, physical interactions between the food boluses and the esophageal wall are modulated based on the feedback from mechanoreceptors, which are pressure and strain sensitive.

The sensors also function as built-in measurement probes to complement some of the clinical bolus transit evaluation instrumentations.

Synthetic systems designed from the bottom-up can enable the building of complex interconnected devices via rational approach, supported by mathematical modelling. However, such process is affected by different, usually non-modelled, unpredictability sources, like cell burden. Methods: Here, we analyzed a set of synthetic transcriptional cascades in Escherichia coli. We aimed to test the predictive power of a simple Hill function activation/repression model (no-burden model, NBM) and of a recently proposed model, including Hill functions and the modulation of proteins expression by cell load (burden model, BM). To test the bottom-up approach, the circuit collection was divided into training and test sets, used to learn individual component functions and test the predicted output of interconnected circuits, respectively. Results: Among the constructed configurations, two test set circuits showed unexpected logic behaviour. Both NBM and BM were able to predict the quantitative output of interconnected devices with expected behaviour, but only the BM was also able to predict the output of one circuit with unexpected behaviour. Moreover, considering training and test set data together, the BM captures circuits output with higher accuracy than the NBM, which is unable to capture the experimental output exhibited by some of the circuits even qualitatively. Finally, resource usage parameters, estimated via BM, guided the successful construction of new corrected variants of the two circuits showing unexpected behaviour. Conclusions: Superior descriptive and predictive capabilities were achieved considering resource limitation modelling, but further efforts are needed to improve the accuracy of models for biological engineering.',\n",

A common approach is to connect the skills that realize a semantically defined operation in the planning domain - such as picking or placing an object - to specific executable functions. As a result the skills are treated as independent components, which results into suboptimal execution. In this paper we present an approach where the execution procedures and the planning domain are specified at the same time using solely extended Behavior Trees (eBT), a model formalized and discussed in this paper. At run-time, the robot can use the more abstract skills to plan a sequence using a PDDL planner, expand the sequence into a hierarchical tree, and re-organize it to optimize the time of execution and the use of resources. The optimization is demonstrated on a kitting operation in both simulation and lab environment, showing up to 20% save in the final execution time.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': '© 2017 IEEE.Objective: This work presents a method for the use of a soft multi-axis force sensor to determine tissue trauma in Minimally Invasive Surgery. Despite recent developments, there is a lack of effective haptic sensing technology employed in instruments for Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS). There is thus a clear clinical need to increase the provision of haptic feedback and to perform real-time analysis of haptic data to inform the surgical operator. This paper establishes a methodology for the capture of real-time data through use of an inexpensive prototype grasper. Fabricated using soft silicone and 3D printing, the sensor is able to precisely detect compressive and shear forces applied to the grasper face. The sensor is based upon a magnetic soft tactile sensor, using variations in the local magnetic field to determine force. The performance of the sensing element is assessed and a linear response was observed, with a max hysteresis error of 4.1% of the maximum range of the sensor. To assess the potential of the sensor for surgical sensing, a simulated grasping study was conducted using ex vivo porcine tissue. Two previously established metrics for prediction of tissue trauma were obtained and compared from recorded data. The normalized stress rate (kPa.mm-1) of compression and the normalized stress relaxation (ΔσR) were analyzed across repeated grasps. The sensor was able to obtain measures in agreement with previous research, demonstrating future potential for this approach. In summary this work demonstrates that inexpensive soft sensing systems can be used to instrument surgical tools and thus assess properties such as tissue health. This could help reduce surgical error and thus benefit patients.',\n",
